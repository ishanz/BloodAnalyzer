Read me ***I sent the pictures file to your UVA webmail. The result can be checked.*** 
1.	In some pictures, I key in the wrong word ‘frame’ in the X label and the title.
The word ‘frame’ should be ‘Second’.
2.	In the three Mp4 , they move the camera at 8:30 (510sec)for 1000pg.mp4
                                   7:55(475sec) for 125pg.mp4
                                   8:20(500sec) for 0pg.mp4
This movement makes a large effect of 125pg and 0pg.
And also make an effect of 1000pg.
3.	We can find that T1=1.5 T2=2.5 maybe can be a better choice.
4.	In the three MP4, the dropping occur at 2:26(146sec) for 0pg.mp4
                                 1:27(87sec) for 125pg.mp4
                                 1:42(102sec) for 1000pg.mp4
5.	The region we want in the three mp4, their position are the same.
So we do not have to change the crop region. (I had checked it.)
6.	We can consider the same T1.T2 for the three mp4. Or make them different from each other. I think the same T is better.
7.	The objects of three M.file are that:
 Exp_for_mp4.m: The new code for computing different pixels and plot the result.
 Exp_different_T_for_blackpix.m: Using different T1 to plot the result of blackPix and the % of Black/Dark.
EXP_Find_a_appropriate_T.m: Using different colors to recognize different gray scale in the frame to find the appropriate T by eyes. I think this file is not important after I used different T to plot the result. But you guys can try to check it by this file.    



I forgot that I have a Midterm Exam in Monday Night. I try to do all I can do for this Exp.
